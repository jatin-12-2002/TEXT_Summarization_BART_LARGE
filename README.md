### Step 6: Add the pre-trained model in your project structure. I had trained the model already.
As **model** is very large in size(600 MB), So I cannot push it into github repository directly. So, you had to update it manually in and you had to insert the model folder in your project structure.

You can download the **model** from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18thJ3tCBd4BUTqHE9chj_Y8fQw-8Nz_G?usp=sharing)
